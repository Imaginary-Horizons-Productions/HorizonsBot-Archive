# HorizonsBot
HorizonsBot is the helper bot for the Imaginary Horizons Discord community server. It automates channel petitions and periodic club attendance reminders.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/Imaginary-Horizons-Productions/HorizonsBot/wiki) for dev setup, style notes and a list of commands.

## Features
Here's a list of some of HorizonsBot's features:
### Slash Commands

Fully supporting slash commands means command options are self-documented and integrate with Discord's UI.

### Rich Responses

HorizonsBot uses message embeds, ephemeral messages, and even buttons and select menus to display information cleanly, cut down on spam, and have intuitive UI respectively.

### Club Reminders
